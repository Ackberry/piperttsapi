I am working on a robot which would be integrated with raspberry pi 5 and would use modules specific to RPI5/Linux.
I also have a module (named Piper TTS) which I am going to integrate in raspberry pi. While installing and trying to
convert text to speech, it requires a lot of bash commands, which I think is not feasible for the general public (the 
robot is targeted to help old aged people.)
You are tasked to create a script/api in python that would be used to directly convert text (in a given .txt file) to speech;
in short, running the python script should be enough to convert the text to speech. Also, keep in mind that the text file, piper module folder, 
and the script, and even the output everything would be in one single folder, so write code accordingly. 

Keep these steps in mind:

1. When you run the script, the script should automatically detect a txt file in the same folder. Ask the user to select a specific txt file if
there are multiple txt files in the folder.

2. piper module uses a voice model (.onnx extension) and a config file (json). Different voice models have different names and such. However, write
the script in such a way that it by default detects the given onnx file and the json file and runs accordingly.
